# CodeAlpha_ObjectDetection

This project implements a real-time Object Detection and Tracking system. It utilizes OpenCV for video input (webcam) and a pre-trained YOLO model for detecting objects in each frame. An object tracking algorithm (e.g., SORT) is applied to maintain consistent IDs for detected objects across frames, and the output is displayed in real time with bounding boxes, labels, and tracking IDs.
