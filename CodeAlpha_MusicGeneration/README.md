# CodeAlpha_MusicGeneration

This project focuses on generating new musical sequences using Artificial Intelligence. It involves collecting MIDI music data, preprocessing it into a suitable format, building and training a deep learning model (such as an RNN with LSTM layers) to learn music patterns, and then using the trained model to generate novel musical pieces. The generated sequences will be converted back into MIDI format for playback or saving.
